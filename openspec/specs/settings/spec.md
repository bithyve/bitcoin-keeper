# Settings Specification

## Purpose

The Settings domain owns all app-wide user preferences and configuration surfaces:
Electrum node management, Tor routing, Bitcoin network selection, display currency,
unit display, theme, language, login method, wallet visibility management, multi-user
accounts, and version history. Changes made here persist across app restarts and
propagate immediately to all other domains that depend on these values.

---

## Requirements

### Requirement: Node Configuration

The app MUST allow the user to add, connect, disconnect, and delete custom Electrum
servers. Each server is configured with a host, port, and SSL toggle. Only one server
may be actively connected at a time. The app MUST offer a curated list of public
servers alongside the option to enter a private server manually or by scanning a QR
code. When the user connects to a new server the previously connected server MUST be
disconnected first. A server that is currently connected MUST require explicit
disconnection confirmation before it is deleted.

#### Scenario: Add and connect a private Electrum node

- GIVEN the user is on the Node Settings screen
- WHEN  the user taps "Add New Node", enters a host, port, and SSL preference, and
  saves
- THEN  the app attempts to connect to the specified server
- AND   on success a toast confirms the connection and the node appears in the list
  marked as connected

#### Scenario: Connection to private node fails

- GIVEN the user enters an unreachable host and port
- WHEN  the user saves the new node
- THEN  the app displays an inline connection error message
- AND   the node is not added to the saved list

#### Scenario: Connect to a predefined public server

- GIVEN the Node Selection screen is open showing the Public Servers tab
- WHEN  the user selects a predefined server from the list
- THEN  the app connects to that server and returns to the Node Settings screen with
  the newly connected server shown as active

#### Scenario: Scan QR to add a node

- GIVEN the user is on the Node Selection screen
- WHEN  the user opens the QR scanner and scans a valid Electrum server QR
- THEN  the host and port fields are pre-populated from the QR data
- AND   the user can save and connect without re-entering the details manually

#### Scenario: Delete a connected node

- GIVEN a node is currently connected
- WHEN  the user requests to delete that node
- THEN  the app shows a disconnection warning modal before proceeding
- AND   on confirmation the node is disconnected, deleted, and removed from the list

#### Scenario: No node connected warning

- GIVEN the node list is empty or no node is connected
- THEN  the app displays a warning note indicating that no node is connected

---

### Requirement: Tor Routing

The app MUST allow the user to enable Tor routing for all network traffic. Two Tor
methods are available: in-app Tor and Orbot (system-level). The app MUST display the
current Tor connection status (OFF, CONNECTING, CONNECTED, ERROR, CHECKING) at all
times on the Tor Settings screen. When Orbot is selected the app MUST open the Orbot
application and check connection status when the app returns to foreground.

#### Scenario: Enable Tor via Orbot

- GIVEN the user is on the Tor Settings screen and Tor is currently OFF
- WHEN  the user taps "Tor via Orbot" and confirms in the modal
- THEN  the app opens Orbot and sets the status to CHECK_STATUS
- AND   when the user returns to the app the connection status is refreshed

#### Scenario: Tor connection status reflects current state

- GIVEN the user is on the Tor Settings screen
- WHEN  the screen loads or the refresh icon is tapped
- THEN  the app checks the Tor connection and updates the status label accordingly
  (Connected, Disabled, Connecting, or Error)

#### Scenario: Tor connection fails

- GIVEN the user has enabled Tor
- WHEN  the connection cannot be established
- THEN  the status label shows "Error"
- AND   a refresh button is visible so the user can retry

---

### Requirement: Bitcoin Network Selection

The app MUST allow the user to switch between Mainnet and Testnet. Switching network
MUST disconnect the current Electrum node, update the active network, connect to
default nodes for the new network, create a default wallet and signer for the new
network if one does not already exist, and re-fetch fee rates. The user MUST confirm
the network change before it is applied.

#### Scenario: Switch from Mainnet to Testnet

- GIVEN the current network is Mainnet
- WHEN  the user selects Testnet and confirms the change
- THEN  the app switches to Testnet, syncs with a Testnet Electrum node, and shows
  a success toast
- AND   all wallet and vault views reflect Testnet balances and addresses

#### Scenario: Network switch fails

- GIVEN the user has initiated a network switch
- WHEN  the Electrum connection for the new network cannot be established
- THEN  the app shows an error toast
- AND   the network setting remains on the previous value

#### Scenario: Confirm dialog prevents accidental switch

- GIVEN the user has selected a new network in the modal
- WHEN  the user taps Cancel instead of Confirm
- THEN  the network is not changed and the modal closes

---

### Requirement: Display Currency

The app MUST allow the user to select a fiat currency from a supported list for
displaying BTC values. Exchange rates MUST be fetched from an external rate source on
login and after network switches. If the selected currency does not have a current
exchange rate available the app MUST alert the user and decline to apply the change.

#### Scenario: Change display currency to EUR

- GIVEN the user is on the General Preferences screen and the current currency is USD
- WHEN  the user opens the currency picker and selects EUR
- THEN  all BTC-denominated amounts across the app are shown in EUR using the latest
  fetched exchange rate

#### Scenario: Currency without exchange rate rejected

- GIVEN the exchange rate for a particular currency is not available
- WHEN  the user attempts to select that currency
- THEN  the app shows an alert explaining the rate is unavailable
- AND   the active currency code remains unchanged

#### Scenario: Exchange rate unavailable (network failure)

- GIVEN the device cannot reach the exchange rate API
- WHEN  the app attempts to refresh rates
- THEN  a toast informs the user that rates could not be updated and values may be
  outdated
- AND   the previously cached rates are used for display

---

### Requirement: Unit Display (Sats Mode)

The app MUST allow the user to toggle between BTC and satoshis as the primary display
unit. The selected unit MUST be reflected immediately across all balance, fee, and
amount displays throughout the app.

#### Scenario: Enable sats mode

- GIVEN the current display unit is BTC
- WHEN  the user enables the sats toggle on the General Preferences screen
- THEN  all amounts in the app switch to satoshi display immediately

#### Scenario: Disable sats mode

- GIVEN the current display unit is satoshis
- WHEN  the user disables the sats toggle
- THEN  all amounts revert to BTC display immediately

---

### Requirement: Theme (Dark / Light Mode)

- WHEN  the user enables the Dark Mode toggle on the Settings screen
- THEN  the entire app UI switches to the dark colour palette immediately
- AND   on subsequent launches the app opens in Dark mode

#### Scenario: Switch back to light mode

- GIVEN the app is in Dark mode
- WHEN  the user disables the Dark Mode toggle
- THEN  the app UI reverts to the light colour palette immediately

#### Scenario: Keeper Private tier forces PRIVATE theme variant

- GIVEN the user holds a Keeper Private subscription
- WHEN  the dark mode toggle is enabled
- THEN  the PRIVATE dark theme variant is applied instead of the standard dark theme

---

### Requirement: Language Selection

The app MUST allow the user to select the app language from the supported list. The
currently selected language MUST be shown at the top of the picker. The UI MUST
update to the chosen language immediately upon selection.

#### Scenario: Change app language

- GIVEN only English is in the available languages list
- WHEN  the user opens the language picker
- THEN  English is shown as the only option and is already selected

---

### Requirement: Login Method

The app MUST allow the user to switch between PIN and biometric (Touch ID / Face ID)
authentication. When enabling biometrics the app MUST first verify that a biometric
sensor is available on the device. If biometrics are not enabled in the device
operating system the app MUST surface a prompt directing the user to device Settings.
Switching to biometric MUST require biometric verification before the change is
applied. Switching back to PIN MUST require no additional verification.

#### Scenario: Enable biometric authentication

- GIVEN the user is on the Privacy & Display screen and PIN login is active
- AND   a biometric sensor is available and enabled on the device

- THEN  an inline mismatch error is shown
- AND   the PIN change is not applied until both fields match

#### Scenario: Current PIN entered incorrectly

- GIVEN the user taps "Change Passcode"
- WHEN  the user enters an incorrect current PIN
- THEN  the verification modal shows an error
- AND   the PIN change flow does not proceed

---

### Requirement: Wallet Management

The app MUST provide a Manage Wallets screen that lists all wallets, vaults, and USDT
wallets (both visible and hidden). From this screen the user MUST be able to hide a
wallet, unhide a hidden wallet (after PIN verification), and delete an empty or
watch-only wallet or vault. Showing all hidden wallets on the same screen MUST require
PIN verification. Deletion of a wallet or vault that still holds a balance MUST be

## Non-Goals

- This spec does not cover the subscription purchase or upgrade flows; those are
  owned by the `subscription` domain.
- This spec does not cover the cloud backup or seed backup flows themselves; those
  are owned by `backup-and-recovery`, even though entry points to those flows exist
  in the Settings navigation hierarchy.
- This spec does not cover Canary Vault creation; that is owned by the `vault`
  domain.
- This spec does not cover wallet creation, renaming, or sync behaviour; those are
  owned by the `wallets` domain.
- This spec does not cover the Keeper Concierge support channel; that is owned by
  the `concierge` domain.
- This spec does not define exchange rate data sources or frequency of refresh beyond
  what is observable in the UI.
- This spec does not define the internal implementation of Tor tunnelling or the
  specific Orbot integration protocol.
