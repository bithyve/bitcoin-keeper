# Usdt Specification

## Purpose

The USDT domain owns the complete lifecycle of TRC-20 USDT stablecoin wallets on the
Tron network: wallet creation and import, balance display, receiving funds, gas-free
transfers, transaction history and detail, and wallet settings (rename, hide,
Recovery Key export).

Buy USDT via Ramp Network is **removed from active scope**. The Buy button and Ramp
integration MUST NOT be shown to users.

USDT wallets are labeled **USDT Wallet** in user-facing copy. USDT wallets are
surfaced alongside Bitcoin wallets in the unified home-screen wallet list but are
visually and functionally distinct from all Bitcoin and multi-key entities.

---

## Requirements

### Requirement: USDT Wallet Availability

The app MUST only offer USDT wallet creation and import when the active Bitcoin network is mainnet. On testnet the USDT wallet option MUST NOT be shown in the wallet-type picker.

- THEN the currency-type picker shows only the Bitcoin wallet option and the USDT wallet option is absent

---

### Requirement: USDT Wallet Creation

The app MUST allow the user to create a new USDT wallet by supplying a name and optional description. The app MUST be derived from the app's primary 12-word Recovery Key using BIP-85 so that it is always recoverable from the primary Recovery Key.

- AND the wallet's creation is persisted to the relay server as part of the app image backup

#### Scenario: Wallet name missing

- GIVEN the user is on the USDT wallet creation screen
- WHEN the user attempts to confirm without entering a wallet name

- THEN an empty-state illustration is shown in the transactions area and no transaction rows are rendered

---

### Requirement: Receive USDT

The app MUST display the wallet's GasFree receive address as a scannable QR code and as a copyable text string. The screen MUST remind the user to send only USDT TRC-20 to this address.

---

### Requirement: Send USDT — Amount Entry

The app MUST present a numeric keypad for the user to enter a USDT amount. The app MUST display the wallet's available balance and support a "Send Max" action that populates the maximum sendable amount after deducting fees.

#### Scenario: Enter a valid send amount (happy path)

- GIVEN the user is on the amount-entry screen with a sender wallet that has sufficient balance
- WHEN the user enters a positive USDT amount that is within the available balance minus fees
- THEN the amount is accepted and the user may proceed to the confirmation screen

#### Scenario: Send Max

- WHEN the confirmation screen is displayed
- THEN an activation fee line item is visible in the fee breakdown in addition to the standard transfer fee

#### Scenario: Transfer fails

- THEN the app shows an error toast with the failure reason and stays on the confirmation screen so the user can retry

---

### Requirement: USDT Transaction History

The app MUST display the complete list of transactions for a USDT wallet in reverse-chronological order. Each row MUST distinguish sent from received transactions.

#### Scenario: View full transaction list (happy path)

- GIVEN the user taps a confirmed transaction in the transaction history
- WHEN the transaction detail screen opens
- THEN the screen shows the transaction ID, direction (Sent or Received), USDT amount, date and time, a SUCCEED status badge, and tapping the transaction ID opens the transaction on Tronscan

#### Scenario: View a pending transaction

- GIVEN the user taps a pending transaction that has a trace ID but no final transaction ID
- WHEN the transaction detail screen opens
- THEN the screen shows the trace ID and a CONFIRMING status badge
- AND tapping the trace ID shows an informational toast indicating the transaction is still being processed

update the wallet name and description, hide the wallet, and export the wallet
Recovery Key. Recovery Key export MUST require PIN or biometric re-authentication.

#### Scenario: Rename wallet and update description (happy path)

- WHEN the user edits the name or description and saves
- THEN the updated name and description are reflected on the wallet detail screen and home-screen card

#### Scenario: Hide the wallet

- GIVEN the user is on the USDT wallet settings screen
- WHEN the user taps "Hide Wallet"
- THEN the wallet's visibility is set to hidden

- WHEN the user fails PIN or biometric verification
- THEN the app does not reveal the Recovery Key and remains on the settings screen

---

>
> The Buy USDT via Ramp Network feature is removed. The Buy button MUST NOT be
> shown in the USDT wallet detail screen or any other user-facing surface.
> The Ramp Network integration code may remain but MUST NOT be invoked.

---

### Requirement: Coin Details (Exchange Rate)

The app MUST fetch and store current BTC and USDT market price data from the BitHyve relay service so that exchange-rate context is available for amount conversion within the app.

#### Scenario: Coin details loaded successfully (happy path)

- This spec does not cover health checks or signing-device interactions for USDT wallets.
- This spec does not specify Ramp Network's internal purchase or KYC flow.
- This spec does not cover testnet USDT functionality.
