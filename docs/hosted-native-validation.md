# Hosted native validation

Issue #7059 adds bounded hosted development builds and a disposable first-use UI
smoke. It does not change R4 #7045 or R5 #7058 app code, merge either branch,
change branch protection, or approve a release. Adopt it for R5 after R4's released
baseline is settled and R5 is reconciled against that baseline.

## Handoff

1. **Cloud code complete:** push the final code, run suitable regression checks,
   and record the full PR head in the existing `Codex local handoff`. Keep
   `Required local checks: IOS, ANDROID` and add `HARDWARE` when applicable.
2. **Hosted native validation:** the PR workflow checks out that exact head with
   read-only permissions and no persisted checkout credential. Both platform jobs
   install locked dependencies, build the development app and run the disposable
   startup smoke. Report each platform as `PASS`, `FAIL` or `NOT RUN` with the run
   URL, attempt and tested SHA. A successful build without a successful UI smoke
   is not a platform pass. Any new commit starts this step again.
3. **Short Mac session:** run only the remaining feature-specific native cases,
   fallback builds/UI when hosted setup fails, and physical-device cases. Real
   biometrics, phones/cameras, hardware signers, NFC/USB and signing prompts remain
   explicit. Preserve the existing owner-scoped HARDWARE deferral procedure. A
   later local `LOCAL_FAILED`/`BLOCKED` report cannot be hidden by a hosted pass.
4. **Release review:** inspect the actual exact-head evidence and unresolved
   issues, obtain independent review and explicit owner approval for any signing,
   distribution or submission. CI success grants none of those approvals.

Hosted coverage is deliberately narrow: cold startup to the passcode screen and
entry of a throwaway first passcode through the confirmation screen. Stop before
account/key generation, backup, wallet funding, live transactions or signer use.
Do not mistake this smoke for the R5 deletion matrix, recovery/upgrade validation,
startup performance acceptance or complete release readiness.

## Trust and gate behavior

The existing trusted base-branch gate never checks out or executes PR code and
retains its `keeper/local-validation` status name. The new native workflow uses
`pull_request`, never elevated `pull_request_target` execution. No signing,
environment secrets, release credentials or production configuration are passed
to its jobs.

The gate reads Actions metadata itself. It selects the newest run at the current
source SHA, verifies the workflow path, event, source repository/branch, associated
PR and SHA, and compares every workflow/harness file (including additions and
deletions) against both the current base and the run's base. The latest attempt
must have exactly one successful platform job with successful `Build development
app` and `Run disposable startup smoke` steps. A cancelled/pending run supplies no
pass. A completed run whose other platform failed can still supply its genuinely
successful platform. Partial reruns may lack the other platform in the latest
attempt; use **Re-run all jobs** to establish both platforms together.

Missing metadata, API failures, untrusted changed CI files and incomplete evidence
produce zero hosted passes. Existing local reports remain a fallback. HARDWARE
cannot be filled by simulator evidence. New commits also invalidate owner scope
decisions. Owner deferral still needs a later honest local report recording
physical checks as NOT RUN/DEFERRED; an actual failed physical test cannot be
deferred. No PR-author assertion of a hosted result is parsed as evidence.

This verifies reviewed CI provenance and actual GitHub step results. The native
build still executes PR-controlled Gradle/Xcode/Metro code on its disposable
runner. Integrity checks detect tracked harness changes between phases, but do
not provide an adversarial sandbox against malicious same-user build scripts.
Review native source and CI changes before merging; branch review requirements
remain necessary. The gate does not make an unreviewed app trustworthy.

Bootstrap is intentionally staged: this infrastructure PR can run diagnostics and
test the verifier, but its new workflow is not yet in the protected base, so its
hosted results cannot authorize app PRs. Review and merge the CI-only PR only when
the owner approves. Then a new same-repository PR run using unchanged reviewed CI
files can provide evidence. Fork runs and modified native CI need review/local
fallback. The workflow-run listener is also effective only after the trusted gate
is merged; pre-merge gate tests execute the candidate inline script with mocked
API responses, not a privileged checkout of the candidate.

## Dependency and native-install failures

Use Yarn 1's frozen lock install with lifecycle scripts disabled, followed by the
explicit CI preparation in `.github/native/`. The repository's normal `prepare`
unconditionally invokes CocoaPods and writes a Mac-specific Android SDK path;
running it on Linux is not supported. Do not silently regenerate `yarn.lock`, use
an unlocked install, skip patch failures or replace a failed native build with
Jest. CocoaPods deployment mode likewise exposes Podfile/lock drift.

At the initial sprint baseline `def0d6a90c80287edb4f58ae272cbfc340f00d73`,
`package.json` requests `eslint-plugin-react-native@^5.0.0`, while the lock contains
only `4.1.0`/`^4.0.0`. Other native setup failures may remain after dependency repair.
Repair reproducibility in its owning workstream, rerun the actual new source SHA,
and retain failed outcomes. Do not import the ongoing R4 diagnostic/reproducibility
branch into this infrastructure PR. Its existing Android build diagnostics are
useful diagnostics and do not constitute emulator UI evidence.

## Evidence, runner budget and remaining work

Each platform retains allowlisted source/toolchain/runner metadata and actual
command exit outcomes. Development configuration points service integrations at
loopback and uses dummy Firebase identities. Only the bounded first-use scenario
runs on fresh hosted devices. Raw build/device/Metro/Maestro logs, screenshots,
app bundles, keystores and generated account data are not uploaded. Failed raw
command output stays private to the ephemeral runner; metadata records which
command failed. Keep artifacts for seven days.

The iOS job is capped at 65 minutes and Android at 60 minutes, with command and
emulator boot limits inside those budgets. The jobs have no automatic retries;
new pushes cancel only
this workflow's runs for that PR. Cold native compilation, SDK installation and
CocoaPods can consume substantial hosted minutes. Use job timestamps and the
Actions usage page to report observed runtime and cost; do not describe a failed
dependency preflight's short duration as native-build timing. Current pricing,
included minutes and spending limits depend on the repository's plan.
As checked on 2026-10-17, GitHub's [standard runner rates](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/reference/actions-runner-pricing)
are $0.062/minute for macOS and $0.006/minute for Linux x64. At those rates a
30-minute iOS plus 30-minute Android attempt is about $2.04; reaching both job
caps is about $4.39, before included minutes, artifact storage, rounding and the
existing CI jobs. These are planning estimates, not measured native timings or
an account bill. Observed bootstrap results belong in this PR's validation report.
Enable spending limits before routine use if needed.

Phase 1 is the CI/gate contract and honest native attempts. Phase 2 repairs the
owning dependency/native-install blockers and demonstrates both hosted UI passes
on an actual exact head. Until those runs work reliably, use the existing Mac
fallback. Hardware and release approval remain separate in every phase.

## Administrative configuration

Require `keeper/local-validation` and existing `Tests` for merges to `sprint`,
and require review for changes to the gate/native harness. `Native validation
contracts` is a useful additional required check. Do not require both native jobs
unconditionally when local fallback is intended: the combined gate resolves
platform evidence. Administrators should verify the required status app/source,
default-branch workflow availability, Actions runner permissions and private-repo
minute budget. Reading sprint protection returned HTTP 403 with the current
integration, so enforcement could not be independently verified. No protection
configuration was changed or claimed enforced by this work.
