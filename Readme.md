```

## Verify Authenticity of Android APK

Please download an [APK](https://github.com/bithyve/bitcoin-keeper/releases) and keep all these files in the same directory: `Android APK file, SHA256SUM.asc, KEEPER_DETACHED_SIGN.sign`. Make a copy of `Android APK file` and rename it as `Android APK clone`.

Get the public PGP key for `hexa@bithyve.com` (Hexa Team's PGP key) using

```
gpg --recv-key "389F 4CAD A078 5AC0 E28A 0C18 1BEB DE26 1DC3 CF62"
```

or

```
gpg --keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org --recv-key "389F 4CAD A078 5AC0 E28A 0C18 1BEB DE26 1DC3 CF62"
```

**Verify APK certificate**

Rename `Android APK clone.apk` to `Android APK clone.zip` and extract the following file: `/META-INF/HEXAWALL.RSA`. Verify the certificate using `keytool`:

```
keytool -printcert -file HEXAWALLET.RSA
Certificate fingerprints:
	 ...
	 MD5:  5E:92:30:9B:88:F4:A1:17:08:D1:DB:C3:2A:BF:4D:5A
	 SHA1: 38:55:07:26:F4:C6:C4:3E:A2:87:CF:16:11:7C:E6:A5:66:E1:CB:C1
	 SHA256: 77:82:54:70:5D:C4:DA:83:2C:F8:39:96:49:69:FE:AF:63:BD:79:EF:00:0A:34:43:86:0C:7C:AD:A2:55:1C:95
	 Signature algorithm name: SHA256withRSA
	 Version: 3
```

**Verify APK checksum**

Verify the checksum against the APK using:

```
shasum -a 256 --check SHA256SUM.asc
```

Output should contain the name of the APK file followed by **OK** as shown below:

```
Bitcoin_Keeper_Beta_v1.1.8.apk: OK
```

**Verify that the signed checksum is from hexa@bithyve.com**

```
gpg --verify SHA256SUM.asc
```

Output should show Hexa's PGP key **389F 4CAD A078 5AC0 E28A 0C18 1BEB DE26 1DC3 CF62**:

```
using RSA key 389F4CADA0785AC0E28A0C181BEBDE261DC3CF62
issuer "hexa@bithyve.com"
Good signature from "Hexa Team (Hexa Bitcoin Wallet) <hexa@bithyve.com>"
```

**Alternate method for verifying PGP signature**

Verify the detached signature against the APK file:

```
gpg --verify KEEPER_DETACHED_SIGN.sign Bitcoin_Keeper_Beta_v1.1.8.apk
```

Output should show PGP key **389F 4CAD A078 5AC0 E28A 0C18 1BEB DE26 1DC3 CF62**:

```
using RSA key 389F4CADA0785AC0E28A0C181BEBDE261DC3CF62
issuer "hexa@bithyve.com"
Good signature from "Hexa Team (Hexa Bitcoin Wallet) <hexa@bithyve.com>"
```
